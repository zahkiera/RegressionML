# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.



## Dataset

The dataset `House_Sales_Dataset` contains various features affecting house prices, such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and visualizing relationships.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling missing data.

- **Model Implementation**: Evaluating five regression models including:

  - Random Forest Regressor

  - Linear Regression

  - Decision Tree Regressor

  - Ridge

  - Lasso

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing performance using RÂ² score, mean squared error, and test accuracy.

## How To Run
1. Downlaod both the ipynb file and csv dataset file 
2. Upload in Google Colab for easiest execution
3. Run the cells consecutively
